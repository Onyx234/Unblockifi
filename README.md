# Unblockifi

Unblockifi was my attempt to try and evade my schools website blocking software. Unfortunately my school changed blocking softwares so no I have no use for this.

To those who want to use the website, it should be hosted at http://shanepaton.com/Unblockifi.

For those who don't want to use the website and are just browsing, the website basically just takes in a url then puts it into Google Translate  and translates from english to english (For some reason that worked).
